# Project Symbiosis

An open-source DePIN and AgriAI platform to create a real-time agricultural data oracle, starting in Ethiopia.

## The Problem

Every year, millions of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia and across the globe, the very backbone of our food supply, make billion-dollar decisions about our future with zero data. They are flying blind, battling climate change and market volatility with tools no more advanced than their ancestors'. This leads to lost yields, financial ruin, and threatens our collective food security.

## Our Solution: A Self-Sustaining Ecosystem

Project Symbiosis begins with a free, simple tool for farmers—an AgriAI advisor that uses satellite data and AI to provide crucial advice on planting, pests, and water usage, starting with Ethiopia's most critical crop: teff. But unlike other apps, our solution builds its own infrastructure. Every user can lend their device's spare computing power to a decentralized network that runs the AI, creating a community-owned, zero-cost cloud. The app builds the network, and the network powers the app.

## The True Revolution: The Symbiosis Oracle

The ultimate goal is not an app; it is the creation of a new global utility. The data generated by our network—verified, real-time information on crop health, yields, and climate impact—is the most valuable agricultural dataset ever created for this sector. We are building the 'Symbiosis Oracle': a trusted, decentralized source of truth that will allow commodity traders, insurance companies, and governments to make decisions with unprecedented accuracy, stabilizing markets and helping to prevent famine. We are transforming agricultural data from a guess into a utility.
