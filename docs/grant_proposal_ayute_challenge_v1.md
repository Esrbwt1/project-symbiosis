# Grant Proposal: AYuTe Ethiopia Challenge

**Project Title:** Project Symbiosis: A Decentralized AgriAI Oracle for Ethiopian Smallholders

**Applicant Name:** **Esrom Berhane Woldtensaie**

**Date:** August 13, 2025

### 1. Executive Summary

Project Symbiosis is a novel software platform designed to radically improve the livelihoods of Ethiopian smallholder farmers through accessible AI, while building a foundational data utility for the global agricultural economy. The project has two interconnected layers:

1.  **AgriAI Advisor:** A free, mobile-friendly application providing teff farmers with AI-driven advice on yield optimization, pest detection, and drought resilience, using publicly available satellite data.
2.  **Decentralized Compute Network (DePIN):** The AgriAI app is powered by a peer-to-peer network of users' devices (laptops and phones), creating a low-cost, community-owned infrastructure that eliminates expensive cloud computing fees.

The data generated from the AgriAI app will ultimately feed the **Symbiosis Oracle**, a trusted, real-time source of agricultural data. This proposal requests an initial prize of $20,000 to fund the development of the MVP, conduct a pilot program with 50 teff farmers in the Addis Ababa region, and validate the model's immense potential for scale and social impact.

### 2. Problem Statement

Ethiopia's 6 million teff farmers, who cultivate the nation's staple food, face a crisis of information. They are highly vulnerable to climate change, soil degradation, and pest infestations, yet lack access to the modern data tools necessary to mitigate these risks. Existing digital solutions are often designed for Western industrial farms, are prohibitively expensive, require constant internet connectivity, and ignore the unique agronomy of crops like teff. This data deficit leads to suboptimal yields, income instability, and poses a systemic threat to national food security.

### 3. Proposed Solution & Innovation

Project Symbiosis addresses this problem with a self-sustaining ecosystem.

*   **The Application:** A simple interface allows a farmer to receive personalized recommendations by uploading a photo of their field or confirming their location. Our AI models, trained on Copernicus satellite imagery and open-source agricultural data, provide actionable insights on planting times, fertilizer application, and early warnings for pests. The app will be designed for low-bandwidth environments with an Amharic interface.

*   **The Innovation (DePIN):** The core novelty lies in our infrastructure. Instead of relying on costly cloud servers, the computational workload is distributed across a network of users who contribute their idle device power. Early users (farmers, students) are incentivized to join the network with premium app features, creating a symbiotic loop: the app's success builds the network, and the network makes the app viable at scale. This "community-owned cloud" makes the project uniquely sustainable and scalable.

### 4. Implementation Plan & Timeline (6 Months)

**Phase 1: MVP Development (Weeks 1-8)**
*   **Weeks 1-4:** Develop the core Python backend, AI model integration (using pre-trained models on satellite data), and a simple web-based UI using Streamlit.
*   **Weeks 5-8:** Develop the basic P2P client for compute sharing and refine the AI model specifically for teff crop analysis.

**Phase 2: Pilot Program & Feedback (Weeks 9-16)**
*   **Weeks 9-12:** Onboard 50 teff farmers from co-ops in the Addis Ababa and Debre Zeit area. Provide training and collect initial data (field photos, yield reports).
*   **Weeks 13-16:** Analyze pilot data, measure initial impact on farmers' decision-making, and gather user feedback to iterate on the app's UI/UX.

**Phase 3: Analysis & Grant Reporting (Weeks 17-24)**
*   **Weeks 17-20:** Refine the platform based on pilot feedback. Begin prototyping the "Symbiosis Oracle" data API.
*   **Weeks 21-24:** Compile a comprehensive impact report, analyze the first proprietary dataset, and prepare for wider rollout.

### 5. Budget & Use of Funds ($20,000 USD)

This grant will be the seed that makes the entire project possible.

*   **Founder's Stipend (6 months @ $1,500/month):** $9,000
    *   *Allows for full-time dedication to the project, covering basic living expenses.*
*   **Pilot Program Operations:** $5,000
    *   *Travel expenses for onboarding and supporting farmers in the pilot region.*
    *   *Purchase of mobile data plans for pilot participants to ensure connectivity.*
    *   *Organizing small-scale farmer workshops.*
*   **Technical Infrastructure & Software:** $3,000
    *   *Initial data storage and backup before the DePIN is fully self-sufficient.*
    *   *Domain name registration, API subscriptions (e.g., weather data).*
*   **Contingency Fund:** $3,000
    *   *For unforeseen technical challenges, legal consultation, or additional operational needs.*

### 6. Team

The project is founded and led by **Esrom Berhane Woldtensaie**, a 25-year-old Computer Science student at Addis Ababa University. I possess the core technical skills in Python, AI/ML, and software development required to build the MVP. More importantly, as an Ethiopian, I have a deep, personal understanding of the context and challenges our farmers face. I am not an outsider providing a solution, but a stakeholder building our collective future.

### 7. Sustainability & Vision for Scale

Project Symbiosis is designed for long-term sustainability. Post-pilot, we will operate on a freemium model, where advanced predictive insights are available for a small monthly fee. Our primary revenue stream, however, will be the **Symbiosis Oracle**, where we will sell tokenized, anonymized data access to institutional clients (commodity traders, insurance firms, NGOs). This creates a multi-billion dollar potential that is directly fueled by the free tool we provide to farmers, ensuring the project's social mission and financial success are permanently aligned.
