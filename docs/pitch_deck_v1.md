# Project Symbiosis
### AI for Farmers, Infrastructure for the Future.

### **Slide 2: The Problem**

## Our farmers are flying blind.

*   **6 million+** teff farmers in Ethiopia face critical decisions every day that determine their income and our nation's food security.
*   They battle **climate change, soil degradation, and pests** with little to no data.
*   Existing "AgriTech" is **too expensive, too complex**, and built for Western industrial farms, not for Ethiopian smallholders.

**This is a multi-billion dollar problem of information inequality.**

---

### **Slide 3: Our Solution**

## A self-sustaining ecosystem that puts AI into the hands of farmers.

**(Diagram: A simple flywheel graphic: [App for Farmers] -> [Generates Data] -> [Powers Network] -> [Improves App])**

1.  **AgriAI Advisor:** A FREE and simple app that analyzes a photo of a field and provides immediate, actionable advice for teff farmers.
2.  **Symbiosis DePIN:** The app is powered by a network of the users' own devices. A **community-owned cloud** that makes the system virtually free to run.

---

### **Slide 4: The Product MVP (Live Demo)**

## We have already built a functional prototype.

**(Screenshot of the web app's upload page next to a screenshot of the analysis results page)**

*   **Working App:** Users can upload an image and get a real AI-powered analysis in seconds.
*   **Working Network:** We have a functional prototype of our DePIN, where "compute nodes" can register to our network.

**This is not just an idea. It is a working reality.**

---

### **Slide 5: Why Now? The Technology is Ready.**

## We are at the intersection of three massive technological shifts.

*   **AI Democratization:** Powerful, open-source AI models are now free to use and adapt.
*   **Satellite Imagery:** High-resolution earth observation data (from Copernicus, etc.) is now a free public utility.
*   **Decentralization (DePIN):** We can now coordinate thousands of devices to create powerful, community-owned infrastructure, bypassing costly centralized cloud providers like AWS.

### **Slide 6: The Vision - The Symbiosis Oracle**

## The app is the beginning. The data is the future.

*   Every photo and data point from our farmers creates the **most valuable agricultural dataset** for this region.
*   This data will power the **Symbiosis Oracle**: a trusted source of truth for real-time agricultural information.
*   **Who will pay for this?**
    *   Global Commodity Traders (predicting coffee/teff futures)
    *   Insurance Companies (pricing crop insurance)
    *   Governments & NGOs (preventing famine)

**We are building the foundational data layer for the future of food.**

---

### **Slide 7: Go-To-Market Strategy**

## Start local, scale global.

1.  **Phase 1 (Now): Teff in Ethiopia.**
    *   Partner with farmer co-ops in the Addis Ababa region.
    *   Solve a critical local problem (food security) to build trust and a unique dataset.
    *   **Goal: 50 farmers in a 6-month pilot.**

2.  **Phase 2: High-Value Crops.**
    *   Expand to coffee farmers. The data here has immediate, high-value global applications.

3.  **Phase 3: The Open Network.**
    *   Open the Symbiosis Oracle and the DePIN compute network to other developers.

### **Slide 8: The Ask**

## We are seeking a $20,000 grant to launch our pilot program.

**(A simple pie chart showing the budget allocation)**

*   **$9,000 - Founder Stipend:** To allow for 6 months of full-time, focused work.
*   **$5,000 - Pilot Operations:** For field-testing with 50 farmers (data plans, travel, workshops).
*   **$3,000 - Infrastructure:** Initial server costs, APIs, domains.
*   **$3,000 - Contingency:** For unforeseen challenges.

**This seed capital is the only thing standing between our prototype and real-world impact.**

### **Slide 9: The Team**

## Built in Ethiopia, for Ethiopia, by an Ethiopian.

**(Your photo here)**

*   **Esrom Berhane Woldtensaie: Founder**
*   25-year-old Computer Science student at Addis Ababa University.
*   Technical skills in Python, AI, and Full-Stack Development.
*   **Unique Advantage:** I have the local context and lived experience to build a solution that truly works for our community.

---

### **Slide 10: The Call to Action**

## Join us in building the future of agriculture.

**(Image: The same farmer from the first slide, but now smiling, looking at the results on their phone.)**

*   **The Vision:** A world where every farmer has the data to thrive.
*   **The Ask:** $20,000 to empower the first 50 farmers.
*   **The Impact:** A sustainable, scalable, and profitable solution to one of the world's most pressing problems.

**Thank you.**
